# Hello! Welcome to KW's personal page.

I will document here the technologies I have researched and found interesting, which could range from tutorials to organized knowledge. This is to facilitate easy reference for myself in the future, allowing me to review previously studied content and share it more effectively with engineers around me.

> Self-introduction again:
> - During my student years, I majored in `Communication`. However, fueled by my personal passion for programming, I directly pursued a position in pure software development after graduation.
> - Currently, I hold the position of a `Front-end Engineer`, and my goal is to transition to backend development when I reach a proficient level in the frontend. Ultimately, I aspire to become a full-stack engineer.
> - I enjoy imaginative thinking and have a penchant for retaining my own interpretations when encountering interesting technologies or articles. This is one of the reasons why I started accumulating `Notes`!
> - If you find my content interesting, feel free to share it with others. The more people who review and provide feedback, the better I can enhance my knowledge. So, please don't hesitate to offer your insights and guidance!
